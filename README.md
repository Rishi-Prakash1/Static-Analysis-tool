# Static-Analysis-tool 
Static String Analyzer is a Python-based static analysis tool designed for cybersecurity professionals, malware analysts, and researchers. It specializes in processing .txt files containing extracted strings from potentially malicious files, helping users identify useful strings and gain insights into malware behavior.

## Features
<ul>
<li>Windows API Identification: Detects and highlights references to Windows API calls commonly used in malware.</li>
<li>Executable File Detection: Scans for .exe references to identify dependencies or secondary payloads.</li>
<li>URL Extraction: Captures embedded URLs to uncover potential command-and-control servers, phishing links, or other malicious network indicators.</li>
<li>File Reference Detection: Identifies and categorizes references to additional files, including paths and filenames, aiding in deeper analysis.</li>
<li>Focused String Analysis: Processes raw string dumps from files to extract actionable information efficiently.</li>
</ul>

## Why Use Static String Analyzer?
Analyzing raw string dumps manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. Static String Analyzer streamlines this process by identifying high-value strings, categorizing them, and providing structured outputs for better understanding.

## How It Works
<ol>
  <li>Provide a .txt file containing strings extracted from a target binary or file.</li>
  <li>The tool scans the text for patterns such as Windows APIs, URLs, .exe references, and more.</li>
  <li>Outputs a structured report categorizing the findings for easy interpretation.</li>
</ol>

## Use Cases
<ul>
  <li>Malware Reverse Engineering: Quickly identify critical strings without executing the malware.</li>
  <li>Threat Intelligence: Extract indicators of compromise (IOCs) for further investigation.</li>
  <li>Forensic Investigations: Assist in analyzing malicious artifacts from incidents.</li>
</ul>
